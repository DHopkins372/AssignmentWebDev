            <h1>A reflection on my Project</h1>
            <p>Throughout learning the intricacies of HTML and CSS there have been many positives and negatives to take away. Learning these two languages taught me a lot about general coding principles. During this project, the basics came around quickly as they were simple, for example writing in paragraphs and headings within HTML. The debugging and syntax of HTML was straight forward as the code is limited to tags and items to go within these tags. CSS was difficult at first because this was the first time, I had used it. The syntax was simple but CSS itself had a lot of features which can be confusing at first. Once I had figured out CSS, I found the coding similar to that of Pseudocode as it was similar to English language. My main problem with using these two languages in unison is when trying to format a webpage the way I  want edit. I found I had to compromise a lot of my ideas so that it could actually work within HTML and CSS. Once I had compromised, I had realised that I can get close to my original ideas using certain tags and functions in both CSS and HTML.</p>
            <h2>Module Reflection</h2>
            <p>I feel as if the module taught me everything I needed for this project. Everything that was requested was taught so it was a case of applying what I learned to this project. The module itself taught me a lot about the process of coding and debugging within HTML and CSS, thanks to the tasks and examples. The most helpful parts were the formatting teaching which taught adding columns and grid layouts. The grid layout helped the flow of my pages where it was needed as well as grouped everything together neatly.</p>
            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <p>In terms of the design choices of this project the main one would be the navigation bar. This is situated at the top of the screen with 5 links to each page. I kept this simple as most websites use a similar setup. Another key design choice was my use of colour within the website. I used beige as the background colour of every page. Another colour used was a darker beige colour called burlywood which was intended for the navigation bar, header and footer. The last colour I went with for the CV page was a colour called bisque which was a light salmon colour for the paragraphs on the CV page. These colours gave of a desert rock theme for the pages which kept a focus upon the content more than anything else. I kept the text black so that it could be clearly read by users on the site. Another decision made was the font I used on the pages. For any text I used Arial as it is a simple font and easy to read. The other font used was Verdana which appears a bigger font with large spacing therefore I used it within the headings of each page. All the validated files are tp the right.
