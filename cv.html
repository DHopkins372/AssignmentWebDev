        <main>
            <p>I am a highly organised hard worker who is currently a Computing Student at the university of Northampton. My qualifications range from A to C at A-level and 8-4(A-C) at GCSE. I feel as if I am a hard worker who can pit his head down and finish any task.
               I previously worked two differnet jobs. A retail assistant at Smyths Toys Superstore and A retail Assitant/lab help at Specsavers. both these jobs have helped hone my skills within the workplace.
               The skills i feel resonate with me most are my ability and determination to do a task with my best effort. Within my past two jobs i would always actively listen and get things done when needed.
               My main interest is in the world of Computing and hope to enter a career path that relates to it within the future. </p>

            <p>Outside of work i am very interested into video games, music and basketball. I really enjoy playing video games as it allows for me to de-stress after any sort activities. Its also great as it allows me to talk with my friends.
                Music is another great past time as it keeps me calm and focused when i am doing anyhting really such as a task or university work.
               Basketball is a new found hobby as i really enjoy watching it and supporting a team. The game is heavily teamwork based and is really thrilling to watch. </p>
